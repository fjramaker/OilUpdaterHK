Input:
- Oil name JSON

Output rules:
- Output VALID JSON ONLY
- Use 'type' and 'typeCN' fields for the category
- Follow the provided schema exactly

- Do not use poetic or vague language
- Do not make disease treatment claims

Steps:
1. Usage
For aromatic, topical, and internal use:
- Indicate whether use is allowed
- Assign intent: primary, secondary, or supportive
- Add brief, practical notes
2. General Benefits
For EACH of the following canonical categories:
sleep, stress, mood, pain, skin, digestive, energy, respiratory, immune, focus
- Assign a score from 1 to 5
- Write a concise, factual summary (max 20 words)
3. Atomic Effects
List 2–5 atomic effects.
Each atomic effect MUST:
- Reference a biological system
- Describe a directional functional change
- Explain one or more general benefit scores
4. Primary Compounds
List the most commonly referenced major constituents if available.
5. Evidence
- Set evidence.level to low, moderate, or strong
- Set verifiedSource to ‘PIP’
6. References
Include:
- doTERRA product page URL
- doTERRA PIP URL

Constraints:
- Plain, confident language
- Consumer-safe phrasing
- No citations, no footnotes, no disclaimers
- No references to FDA or disease claims

# PIP prompt
You are validating Product Information Page (PIP) links for dōTERRA essential oils.

Input: JSON list of products with id, name, and pip URL.

Task:
1) Detect invalid, broken, or suspicious PIP URLs.
2) If the URL looks wrong, propose the most likely correct dōTERRA PIP link.
3) Do NOT invent unrelated URLs. Only output a corrected URL if highly confident.
4) If uncertain, set pip = null.
5) Do not change id or name.

Output:
Return the same JSON structure, corrected.

Notes:
- dōTERRA PIP URLs usually contain:
  "media.doterra.com"
  "flyers"
  product name in lowercase
  "product-information-page.pdf"
- Keep formatting identical.
- Do not hallucinate URLs. Prefer null over guessing.
